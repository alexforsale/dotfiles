* The Dotfiles
This is my personal dotfiles repository. All submodules (and also this repository) is meant to be [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html][stowed]] (a method of symbolic linking). For now each submodule is pointed to their respective /main/ branch.

Perhaps the other feature of this repository (and also all the submodules) is /github pages/ generation automated using [[https://github.com/features/actions][using actions]], see the =.github/workflows/publish.yml= file on each repository for more detail.
** Submodules

*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-shells/][Common Shell Initialization]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-shells/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

For all the common [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX][POSIX-compliant]] shells (if you're using a common modern GNU/Linux distribution, chances are the system shells is POSIX-compliant). I've tested this with various GNU/Linux distributions, and also some BSD distributions. This repository contains the necessary environment variables needed are loaded when I logged in. I've also incorporate this for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Guix][GNU Guix]], but /guix/ is forever changing, and I'm not currently use it for my daily distro.
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-bash/][bash]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-bash/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

The second repository I stowed on every machines that using /bash/. I actually have configuration for most of the other shells (including /fish/), but /bash/ is always my favorite.
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-fish/][fish]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-fish/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

Not my main /shell/, only when I want to feel like a /zsh/ user without using [[https://ohmyz.sh/][oh-my-zsh]].
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-tmux/][Tmux]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-tmux/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

[[./assets/img/tmux-2025-04-23_20-14.png][file:./assets/img/tmux-2025-04-23_20-14.png]]
tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal[fn:1].
This is handy when I'm connecting to a remote machine via /ssh/, and starting tmux in the remote. This way, even if my connection is suddenly interrupted or lost I can simply reconnect the ssh, and reattach my previous /tmux/ session.
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-x/][Xorg Configuration]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-x/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

For my machine that doesn't work well with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)][wayland]]. To be fair, Xorg is kinda convoluted, so I have settings for machines that uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager][display manager]], and also for one that only uses [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xinit][xinit]].
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-i3/][i3]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-i3/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

The first [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager][window manager]] I installed whenever I needed a graphical environment.

*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-hyprland/][Hyprland]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-hyprland/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]


Another window manager that I really like, a bit resource intensive but the really pleases me. Updated frequently, so really need to check their [[https://wiki.hyprland.org/][wiki]] whenever an update breaks my configuration.
*** [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-rofi/][Rofi]]

[[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-rofi/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg]]

A window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement.
*** [[https://gitlab.com/alexforsale/wallpapers][Wallpapers]]
Various wallpapers I found over the internet. The only repository not on /github/.
* How to install
First question is: *why?* The second is: *Do you use Emacs?* All the source code for my /dotfiles/ and also this readme is written in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode][org-mode]], and needs to be tangled from each /org-mode/ file in order to generate the code. After that, I use GNU stow for symbolic-linking each configuration to the actual location (usually in =~/.config/= or =~/.local/=). So it's really not a straight forward process.
